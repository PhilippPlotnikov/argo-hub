# Codefresh Hub for Argo

Share and Reuse Your Argo Workflows with the Codefresh Argo Hub.

## Motivation
Anyone who builds a lot of Argo workflows knows that after a while you end up reusing the same basic steps over and over again. While Argo Workflows has a great mechanism to prevent duplicate work, with templates, these templates have mostly stayed in people’s private repositories and haven’t been shared with the broader community.

## Goals
* Allow people to find easily useful steps and flows for building even more awesome workflow
* Offer the confidence that a template is safe to use
* Enable all organizations to share their templates with the community
* Help the Argo community grow faster by knowledge reuse
